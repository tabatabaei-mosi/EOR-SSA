# EOR-SSA

The scope of this project is to design a neural network model to predict EOR method for a given reservoir and using Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA) to optimize the model. Combination of SSA and neural network is called EOR-SSA (hybrid model). The provided code will use SSA to optimize the weights and biases (parameters) of the neural network.


## How to use the code

1. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Make some changes in the `src` directory python files.
3. Upload the dataset to the `src/data` directory.
4. Run the code: `python src/main.py`.
5. The results will be saved in the `Log_File` directory.
